## The Problem

There is a Raspberry Pi at the front of the room with a hat with RGB LEDs on it. We are going to write a Cloudflare Workers application to add colors to it, both random and of our own choosing

## Steps to complete

1. Register a free Workers account using workers.dev
1. Install Wrangler
1. Use Wrangler to install a boilerplate router
1. Configure Wrangler and set your API key in `wrangler.toml`
1. Create routes using the router boilerplate
